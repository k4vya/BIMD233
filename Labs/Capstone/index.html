      My Portfolio Ideas

    <p>
      I am an aspiring UX designer at the University of Washington. I'm interested in web design, user research, prototyping, data wrangling and visualization. I am interested in making technology more accessible to people of all ages, abilities, and origins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want people to learn about my experiences in tech and design and the main takeaways I got from each assignment. I want to include perhaps a reflection of each assignment, and its main learning points.
